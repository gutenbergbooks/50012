<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Well now this is something like an adventure. (<i>putting down
the umbrella and bandbox</i>, <small>R</small>.) There’s a romantic mystery attached to me
that I can’t unravel, in fact I feel myself like a tangled penn’orth of thread; the more I
try to clear myself the more complicated I become. Let me calmly consider my singular
position. (<i>throws the cloak on the easy chair</i>, <small>R</small>. <i>and places the
carpet bag beside it</i>) In the first place here I have arrived at the Hotel d’
Angleterre in Dieppe accompanied by the Countess de Rambuteau—a real Countess! Poor Mrs.
Greenfinch little dreams what a rake I am—but for a long time I’ve been dying for an
aristocratic flirtation—I have looked at lovely women in the private boxes at the
theatres—and have run after carriages in the park—but all in vain, and now, startling as
the fact may seem, I have been for the last thirty hours the travelling companion of a
French Countess, and have shared her post-chaise from Paris: when I say shared, I mean the
Countess and her maid took the inside and left me the outside, where I was exalted to the
dickey amongst a miscellaneous assortment of trunks and bandboxes, by which I have been
jolted and jammed till I haven’t a bone in my body without its particular ache. But the
most extraordinary part of the affair is that I have never yet seen the Countess’s face,
for she has always concealed it from me beneath a thick veil. However that’s nothing,
there’s a secret sympathy by which I think I could discover a pretty face under a
piecrust. Hah! here she comes, and now for the tender revelation—the soft confession—the
blushing avowal—the—</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> M<small>RS</small>. G<small>REENFINCH</small>,
2&nbsp;<small>E</small>.&nbsp;<small>R</small>., <i>in a travelling dress closely veiled,
she carries in her hand a lady’s walking basket.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">Ah, my charming Countess, at length after a painful—I mean a <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-4">[Pg 4]</a></span>delightful journey—we have
arrived in Dieppe, and now permit me to gaze on those lovely features.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. (<i>retires as he approaches</i>) No, no, <i>je ne permittez
pas;</i> nevare, not at all, Monsieur Grinfeench.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Dear, Countess, take pity on me. (<i>aside</i>) What delightful
accents! She told me she could speak English fluently, and she does. Am I never to see
your face, dear Countess? Oh! have pity on me.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. <i>Oui</i>, you sall ordere diner <i>toute de suite.</i></p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Dinner? certainly, Countess.</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit</i> 3&nbsp;<small>E</small>.&nbsp;<small>L</small>.</p>

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. (<i>peeping in at door</i>, <small>R</small>.) Is he gone,
mum?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Yes, Betsy, you may come in. (<i>lays the basket she carries on
table,</i> <small>L</small>. <i>and puts up her veil</i>)</p>

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. (<i>enters by door</i>, <small>R</small>.) Well, mum, does he
suspect nothing yet?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Nothing. He has not yet seen my face—but if he had, I think this
red wig, these spectacles, and this cravat would completely prevent his recognizing
me.</p>

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. He little thinks, mum, ’tis his own lawful wife he’s running away
with instead of a fine foreign Countess.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Oh, Betsy, when I think of that, I could tear his eyes out. A
man, Betsy, that I thought the most faithful creature woman ever was blessed with, to
deceive me so. A working model of a husband that I may say I made out of nothing.</p>

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. Ah, mum, I know what husbands is made of! I was once accidentally
married myself for three weeks to a sea cap’n, who took me, mum, as his mate—but I
diskivered I was only his second mate, for he’d got another wife alive, mum—and so he
slipped hisself through the wedding ring that way. Oh! mum, husbands isn’t to be trusted
no ways.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. ’Twas your experience and advice, Betsy, that put me upon this
plan of trying Mr. Greenfinch’s fidelity. Before he went to Paris about that legacy left
him by his aunt, there wasn’t a more dutiful little husband in Peckham Rye.</p>

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. No, more there wasn’t, mum. But after he’d been a month in Paris,
he wrote to say he’d got into the hands of the French lawyers, and couldn’t return so soon
as he expected.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Upon which I resolved to run over to Paris, if ’twas only for a
day—for I thought he must be miserable without his wife.</p>

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. A very popular delusion amongst women, mum.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. And so as you know, Betsy, I took you with me and crossed to
Boulogne. What I suffered from the roughness of the waves and the custom-house officers I
need not repeat. I didn’t however think of anything but the joyful surprise it would be to
Mr. Greenfinch when I should drop suddenly like a lump of sugar out of heaven into his
solitary tea.</p>

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. Yes, mum, but you know I had my suspicions that it wasn’t the
lawyers kept master in Paris—so I persuaded you to take lodgings opposite the hotel where
he was stopping, and keep a watchful eye on his proceedings from the window, with your
veil down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Yes, Betsy, that was certainly your plan,—and what has been the
consequence? The very first day my gentleman kissed his hand to me—the second day he
performed a love pantomime at his window for my diversion—and the third day he sent me a
daguerreotype portrait of himself backed by a Westphalia ham.</p>

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. And before the week was out you had induced him to run away with
you.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. I’ll never forgive him that.</p>

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. Of course you won’t—you’ve too much spirit to forgive any man,
much less a husband. Now, mum, if you’ll help me in a little plan I’ve hit upon, I think
we’ll torment him to that degree that he’ll never hear a Countess mentioned without
trembling.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. I’ll do anything, Betsy, to make the little wretch
miserable.</p>

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. Well then, mum, this is my plan.</p>

<p class="entrance">G<small>REENFINCH</small> <i>speaks outside</i>,
<small>L</small>.&nbsp;3&nbsp;<small>E</small>.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Hist, I hear him returning; run into my room and I’ll come to
you presently. (<i>draws down her veil</i>)</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit</i> B<small>ETSY</small>,
2&nbsp;<small>E</small>.&nbsp;<small>R</small>.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> G<small>REENFINCH</small>,
3&nbsp;<small>E</small>.&nbsp;<small>L</small>.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. I’ve ordered dinner at five; and now, my charming
Countess—mysterious being, whom I have loved distractedly for three long weeks through
that envious veil—permit me. (<i>about to remove her veil, she motions him to desist</i>)
Well I won’t; delicacy forbids intrusion. However, I hope I may not be considered
particularly inquisitive, if I beg to be informed why you and I should be here in Dieppe
under such mysterious circumstances.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Oh, <i>certainment</i>, Monsieur Grinfeench, I sall confess to
you dat I vas <i>frappè</i> vis your mug—dat is your superbe countenance in de vindere of
your hotel.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Struck by my superb countenance! a clear case of
fascination. My dear Countess, it is no less extraordinary that whenever you were sitting
in your balcony, I generally found myself flattening my nose against the centre pane of my
window.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. <i>Oui</i>, <i>oui</i>, I did regard your flat nose vare mosh,
<i>en attendant</i>, it happen I did find myself in a position <i>tres embarrasant</i>—a
situation of danger; I was in want of a friend—<i>un ami</i>.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. And you thought of me.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. <i>Oui</i>, you were at de top of my mind—dat is, uppermost in
my thoughts.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Tender confession! and then you wrote to me this dear little
note. (<i>produces a note and kisses it</i>) Imagine the indescribable emotion I
experienced in my interior when I opened it and read these lines. (<i>reads</i>)
“Interesting stranger, I am not insense to your merits, but circumstances demand secresy.
I shall be wait for you this evening at nine o’clock in a post carriage outside the <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-6">[Pg 6]</a></span>Barriere
d’Enfer.—P<small>AULINE</small>, Countess de Rambuteau.” I hastened accordingly to the
barrier at the hour named.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Vare I did attend, as vas appoint.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Yes, but instead of inviting me to take a seat beside you, I was
lifted by two fellows, whose muscular developments forbade any opposition on my part, into
the dickey of the carriage—the postillion cracked his whip, away we started—and that is
all I know about the affair.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Ha, ha! I fear I have trespass on your complaisance, your vat
you call spooney disposition—dat is, your good nature.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Countess, my good nature is public property like Kennington
Common—you can’t trespass on it. Is there any other way I can be serviceable to you?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. <i>Oui</i>, dere is one oder little ting; vil you permit me,
vile in dis <i>maison</i>, to be <i>apellez</i> your <i>femme</i>, your best half of de
vorst—to be called Madame Grinfeench?</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Madame:—in English that means Missus—Mrs. Greenfinch!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. <i>Oui</i>. I have particulere reason for my request.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Hem! hem! Perhaps, Countess, you are not aware that there’s a
previous Mrs. Greenfinch at this moment on the British shores; a splendid woman, though I
say it, who sits like a pensive dove mourning for her absent mate at Peckham Rye.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. (<i>aside</i>) There’s some good in him still. Oh dat is no
obelisk in de vay. I go to-morrow in de packey bote, and sall only be your little rib for
a little time.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Why if I thought it was only for a little time I might.
(<i>aside</i>) She’s a lovely creature no doubt, and as Mrs. G. can never know anything of
my delinquency—pooh! what’s there to be afraid of? (<i>to her</i>) Well, Countess, I can
refuse nothing to your sex—consider yourself as the temporary Mrs. Greenfinch.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. <i>Merci, mon ami</i>. (<i>aside</i>) The atrocious wretch!</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Now that point’s settled, may I not in the profane language of
poetic fiction be permitted to feast these longing eyes on those heavenly features?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Ah! you persuade me what you like you leetle rascal.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Gracious condescension! So from the face of heaven the cloud
withdraws and (<i>she has raised her veil; seeing her face he starts</i>) and—ahem! the
face of heaven. (<i>aside</i>) The Countess’s face don’t improve upon close inspection. I
never liked red hair, and I hate green spectacles.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. You like my pheezog?—it is your taste? Ah! <i>oui</i>, now I
sall leave you to change my toilette—<i>restez vous ici</i>, and <i>n’oubliez
pas</i>—don’t forget I am Madame Grinfeench.</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit</i> <small>R</small>.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Shall I ever forget it? never! Hem! The Countess adores me that’s
clear, and if she hadn’t red hair, she’d be a remarkably fine woman. But she may dye her
hair:—Gad, so she may; its only dying for love after all.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. (<i>returning</i>) Ah! I did forget—you must <i>prenez
garde</i>—be <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-7">[Pg 7]</a></span>vide
awake, and take care of our secret, for de most little cause of suspect vill <i>coupez</i>
both our neck at one slice.</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit</i> <small>R</small>.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. What does she mean? I feel I’m up to the ears in some terrible
mystery. I don’t know whether ’tis conscience or cowardice, but my sympathy for the
Countess is evaporating very rapidly, in fact I’m beginning to feel dreadfully
uncomfortable here—why should she want to pass as my wife? Why does she want to escape
from France? Eh? Echo returns no answer to its correspondent! (<i>sees the basket on the
table</i>, <small>L</small>.) Hah! here’s her basket she has forgotten, perhaps it may
contain something to clear up this mystery. (<i>takes basket off table</i>) Bless me, ’tis
very heavy for its size, what can she have in it? (<i>feeling the basket</i>) ’Tis not a
smelling bottle, nor it can’t be a case of razors—Countesses don’t usually shave. I
shouldn’t wonder if it was—no, no, it’s—eh? what is it then? (<i>draws a pistol from the
basket</i>) Ha—a—oh! A p-p-pistol! Oh, dear! there’s more in this than meets the eye!—Why
does she travel with these deadly weapons? Hah! A horrid thought flashes across my
tortured brain—perhaps she’s Abd el Kader in disguise, or more horrible still she maybe a
female bandit intending to make me her unsuspecting victim; murder me perhaps in my sleep;
she looks as if she could do it. (M<small>RS</small>. G. <i>appears watching at door</i>,
<small>R</small>.) Oh, lord! I’ll go this moment and inform the police.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. (<i>entering and intercepting him</i>) <i>Arrétez!</i> Stop!</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. (<i>starting</i>) Ah!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. I have <i>entendez vous.</i></p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Oh, ha—I—I—I merely—ha, ha! You perceive I was——</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. You vas go to betray me; <i>mais</i> you perceive dis little
machine? (<i>produces a pistol from her pocket</i>)</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Oh, oh!—distinctly, Countess.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Madame Grinfeench!</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. I beg pardon, Madame Grinfeench. Pray oblige me by pointing the
other end of that article this way. I’ve an uncommonly weak head, and couldn’t stand
anything from that quarter.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. <i>Prenez garde</i>, then how you betray de <i>confiance</i> I
have put into you?</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. What confidence? I haven’t the most distant idea of the object
for which I have been brought here.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Den I sall vispare at your ear dat you are flying from justice
with a denounced leader of a secret club.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Me!—a Greenfinch flying from justice!—good gracious! what do you
mean?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. <i>Ecoutez donc!</i> de police break in on our meeting—de
officier seize me to take me to quod.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. And what did you do?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Bang! shoot him through the nob—den one, two, tree jump out of
de vindère.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Shot a police officer! (<i>aside</i>) I’m paralysed!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Dey have offer large reward for my take; but if I <span

(<i>clasps him in her arms</i>)</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Her English is not very elegant, but it’s very expressive.
(<i>faintly</i>) I feel the guillotine hanging over me; I shall be sent back to Peckham
Rye a head shorter than I left it.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. <i>Entendez bien</i> that your safety as well as mine depends on
your <i>taisez vous</i>. Remember dat from my chamber dere I can watch, and <i>ecoutez</i>
all dat sall pass here—den, if you go to spleet, I sall sew you up—bang! <i>Comprenez

<p class="direction_r">(<i>shewing pistol, and exit</i>, <small>R</small>.)</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Yes, I <i>comprenez vous</i>—my safety depends on my <i>taisez
vous</i>. What a dreadful situation is mine! If this is having an aristocratic flirtation,
I don’t care how soon I get democratic in my <i>penchants</i> again. This terrible
Countess is a perfect masked battery; I shouldn’t wonder if she had a Colt’s revolver
inside her parasol, and that a cartouche box did duty for a certain popular appendix to
the female figure. I declare I feel quite nervous and agitated—I’ll go and smoke a cigar
in the garden. (<i>takes a cigar from his case</i>) Hah! I wish they may ever catch me
running away with a Countess again.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. So that when he sees it, he may be aware that I am here in my

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. Exactly, mum; and as there’s a way by a passage at the back of

Nothing can be easier than to come out of that door as the Countess, and out of that door

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> G<small>REENFINCH</small>, <small>C</small>., <i>from

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Poo-ah! There’s nothing like a cigar for puffing away
fear—poo-ah! I feel a deal more composed now—poo-ah!—cooler and more determined—poo-ah!
I’ve been bracing up my courage by repeating that heroic maxim—“The brave man dies many
times—a coward never dies at all.” Stay—I don’t believe I’ve got it right—but it don’t
matter. (<i>stumbles over the trunk</i>) What’s here? umph! a trunk! Bless me! surely I

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. No, but my wife has. See here! (<i>reads address on trunk</i>)
“Mrs. Greenfinch, Passenger to Paris.” That’s her writing after six lessons. (<i>in a

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. (<i>coolly</i>) <i>Eh bien!</i> you know that a man can have but

do?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. (<i>aside</i>) Now I’ll prove him. Say that you did nevare see
her.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. How! disown Mrs. G., and turn my back upon my marriage
certificate? (<i>aside</i>) She’s a Mephistopheles in petticoats.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. It but want de courage.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. But I’ve no courage; one look from Mrs. G. would dissolve me into
my own wellingtons.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. This is what I call a tremendous situation. Deny my wife, and
such a wife as Mrs. G.: a woman that won’t be denied. How shall I ever attempt it? And if
I don’t, there’s the Countess prepared to shoot me through the head! Oh, dear! I must have
some brandy to screw up my nerves. (<i>goes to a side table, pours brandy into a glass,

in spite of me. (<i>drinks</i>) There! nothing like brandy. (M<small>RS</small>. G. <i>is
heard singing in room</i>, <small>L</small>.) Hah! that’s her voice—the voice of my
wife—that’s her high G, and that’s her shake. I can’t be mistaken in her shake, for it
makes me shiver all over. Brandy! (<i>drinks</i>) Hah! I must be stern and resolved—the
Countess has her eye upon me, and my wife’s coming. Never mind, I’m prepared for the
worst. More brandy! (<i>drinks</i>) I feel myself growing desperately profligate—I’m

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. Yes, mum; and means to stick to it.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. (<i>aside to</i> B<small>ETSY</small>) Does he? Mr. Greenfinch!
(<i>taking hold of him</i>) you’d better mind what you are doing—I’m not a woman to be

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. (<i>aside</i>) I’m well aware of that; but now that I have the
Countess at my back, I don’t mind aggravating her. (<i>sings</i>) Toll, loll, de roll,

must instantly release me from this horrible compact. I can bear a great deal, but my

Countess! She’s gone. (<i>re-enter from room</i>) She’s certainly not there. Now, if I

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. I thought so. I see you’re dreadfully intoxicated; you’d better
go to bed—do! You’ll be ashamed of yourself in the morning. I never see a gentleman so
drunk in my life—never! Go to bed, I advise you.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Go to the devil! I’ll penetrate this horrid mystery, and know the
worst at once.</p>

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. Then you may depend on having your bones broken.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Hey?—why, this is <i>my</i> card—<i>my</i> name and address. I’m
Gregory Greenfinch, of the Turtle Dovery.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Excuse me, my good fellow, but—ha, ha, ha, ha! your impudence is
highly amusing—ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. What! do you mean to tell me that I am not Greenfinch? That I’m
not the husband of my own wife?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Oh, no; I simply say, I’m Greenfinch.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. You? Then who the devil am I?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. ’Pon my life, I haven’t an idea.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. No! Bless me, that’s very extraordinary. Why, it can’t be
possible! I’ve a strong moral conviction that I am Greenfinch; I feel that I can’t be
anybody else, and that anybody else who presumes to be me is an impostor.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. For all that, <i>I’m</i> Gregory Greenfinch.</p>

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. The poor man’s certainly mad, sir.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. What does she say? Mad—ah! (<i>aside</i>) Horrible suggestion! If
I should be mad! If I should be labouring under a pleasing delusion, and mistake myself
for some other individual! What if he should be me, and me he—no, he me, and me he—no,
that’s not it—what, if I’m he—and me—I mean if I—that’s me—no—he and I are neither he nor
me. Oh, dear! what am I saying?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Well, Mister What’s-your-name, if you have any desire to be shot
in a gentlemanly and artistic manner—there’s a nice quiet spot at the back of the hotel,
fit for the business. Just let me know when you’ve made up your mind, and I’ll be ready in
five minutes to operate.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Stop! destroyer of my peace, and confounder of my identity—stop,

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. (<i>solemnly</i>) The world’s a cage, not wide enough for two

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Stop! We must fight in this apartment.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Here? oh, very well. If you prefer being shot on the premises—I
can have no objection.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. One word more! the sight of a pistol affects my nerves—we must
fight in the dark!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. In the dark! Who ever heard of a duel in the dark? why we may
fight till morning and I may never be able to hit you.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. That’s precisely what I wish; if we fight it must be in the
dark.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Well, if you make it a point, I shan’t dispute it with you, as I
dare say I shall be able to pick you out somehow—I’ll step in for my pistols.</p>

fighting, and as this fellow means to shoot me, it’s my business to prevent him if I can;
so I’ll get behind the stove there, and then he may blaze away as long as he likes. I’ll

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Yes, miserable man, I’ve come that you may go—I’ve got the
popguns!</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Have you? then mind how you point them this way. Where are you?
(<i>crosses to</i> <small>L</small>.)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Here—here—make haste!</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. What a devil of a hurry you’re in! (<i>in groping about he
touches one of the pistols, which</i> M<small>RS</small>. G. <i>holds with extended arm,
and starts back</i>) Oh! you shouldn’t do that—not that I’m afraid—but the sensation is
far from pleasant.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Come, sir, you shall take one and leave me the other.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Thank you. (<i>feels the pistol; aside</i>) The touch of them
throws me into a cold perspiration! I wish I knew which was the mildest of the pair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Haw! Shall we fire at the first word?</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Kill a fellow creature at the first word! Rash young man, we must
have two words to that! Let the signal be “<i>Death and Glory</i>;” you shall take
“<i>Death</i>” and I’ll have “<i>Glory.</i>”</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. And then fire? Very well, now mind your eye. “<i>Death!</i>”</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. (<i>dodging about in great alarm</i>) Hollo! stop! stop! what are
you about? My glory is not ready for death!—let’s deliberate a little!
(G<small>REENFINCH</small> <i>is now behind the stove</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Oh, nonsense! I never deliberate—are you ready?</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Yes—I’m ready now!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Very well, then—look sharp! (G<small>REENFINCH</small> <i>ducks

(G<small>REENFINCH</small> <i>assists her</i>) Ah, you’re a dead shot, Greenfinch!</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Ha! then I <i>am</i> Greenfinch—you confess it?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Yes, you’re the real original Greenfinch. Good bye, my boy, I
forgive you; but you’ll be hanged for my murder if you’re caught!</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Hanged for your murder! You don’t mean that?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. G. Yes, I do; we fought in the dark you know—that’s murder—and
you’ll be hanged for it—but you don’t mind it.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Don’t I though! My good friend, you musn’t think of
dying—consider the fatal consequence to <i>me!</i></p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Good gracious! What do you mean? Hallo! (<i>shaking her</i>)
there’s not a stir in him—he’s dead—dead as the twelve Cæsars. Unfortunate youth! he’s
gone to settle his long account, and has left a heavy balance in my hands. What’s to be
done now? I know:—I’ll conceal him in the bedroom here (<i>moving towards door</i>
<small>R</small>., <i>a scream is heard in room</i> <small>L</small>.) Bless me! what’s
that? Something dreadful, I’m sure! Oh, lord, my knees are sinking under me—I havn’t
strength to move a step further! (<i>staggers against the easy chair</i>) Ha! this
chair—providential thought—I’ll cover him up in it. (<i>he places</i> M<small>RS</small>.
G. <i>in the chair, and throws the travelling cloak, which hangs on the back of the chair
over her, so as to completely conceal her</i>) Now I’ll make a coroner’s inquest of myself

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. Oh, sir! oh, sir! my poor mistress—my poor dear mistress!——</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. What of her, Betsy?</p>

<p>BKTSY. It’s a shocking story, sir, but there’s no use concealing it—the young gentleman
you quarrelled with was my mistress’s cousin—little Charley Bates that you’ve often heard
her speak of.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Her cousin! (G<small>REENFINCH</small> <i>jumps up;</i>

toe</i>) Little Charley?—no-o?</p>

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. Yes, indeed, sir, when you sent me out of the room, I made bold
to listen; and hearing you both agree to fight a duel, I ran and told my mistress.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Proceed, Betsy, proceed!</p>

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. Well, sir, though you had behaved shocking to her, she tried to
prevent mischief; but, la, sir, she had only reached that door (<i>points to door</i>,
2&nbsp;<small>E</small>.&nbsp;<small>L</small>.) and was trying to see what was going
forward between you, when bang bang goes two pistols, and a bullet went right through the
keyhole into my mistress’s eye.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Betsy, support me! (<i>leans on her</i>) Her eye!</p>

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. With her last breath she sent you her blessing, sir, and the key
of the tea caddy. (<i>gives him a small key</i>)</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Sweet, careful martyr!</p>

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. What a shock this will be to poor Master Charley, sir.</p>

<p>G<small>REEN</small>. Hush, Betsy, nothing can shock him now; I confide the secret to
your faithful bosom—he’s dead!</p>

<p>B<small>ETSY</small>. Dead! you havn’t gone and shot him too—poor fellow!</p>
